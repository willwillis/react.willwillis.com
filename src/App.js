        <Paragraph>
          I've been nostalgic for the old and "easy" web for a few years now. Don't get me wrong, websites today are impressively useable, responsive and beautiful. But they're also complicated. Some might argue, overly complicated if you're developing a simple/personal web site.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          placeholder, explain why complicated 
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Also, cloud hosting can get expensive quickly. I know, I know, before you call me out... 
          you can host the latest and greatest JavaScript built websites/frameworks for free with Cloudflare, 
          Netlify and other providers. Who's really comfortable though, building their site on a "free tier"
          that could change at any moment?
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          This is the point where I realize my reasons may not be the most rational... Suffice it to say,
          I wanted to see if it was possible.

          If you are reading this... <i>it's possible</i>! And it wasn't really that difficult either.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          First, create a React app like you normally would. <pre>npx create-react-app my-website</pre>
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Host your code at Github. If you don't know about <pre>git</pre> or version control, start here (link)
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          GitHub not only provides version control, but "Actions". They let you run/build code on their servers... FOR FREE! And yes, 
          you could even host the site at github <a href="https://pages.github.com/">pages</a> without
          having to pay for shared hosting, or lease domain name. I have a very simple 
          <a href="https://github.com/willwillis/react.willwillis.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml">deploy workflow</a>
           that does the following:
           
           <ol>
            <li>Watches for code commits on the <pre>main</pre> branch</li>
            <li>When triggered, the actions build the React application, resulting in some HTML and JavaScript being generated.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the actions transfer those files from the github server to my shared hosting server over FTP.</li>
            </ol>

        <Paragraph>
         I like the semantic tags like paragraph, Row, Col, etc.. I need to have another look at bootstrap. tailwind was a little too much, even anchors were 'reset', I don't think I should have to style every 'a' on the page. but that's probably my lack of understanding.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          The default Typography is small. I can override that tho.
