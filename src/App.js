          I've been nostalgic for the old and "easy" web for a few years now.
          Don't get me wrong, websites today are impressively usable,
          responsive and beautiful. But they're also complicated. Some might
          argue, overly complicated if you're developing a simple/personal web
          site.

        <Paragraph>
          Also, cloud hosting can get expensive quickly. I know, I know, before
          you call me out... you can host the latest and greatest JavaScript
          built websites/frameworks for free with Cloudflare, Netlify and other
          providers. Who's really comfortable though, building their site on a
          "free tier" that could change at any moment?
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          This is the point where I realize my reasons may not be the most
          rational... Suffice it to say, I wanted to see if it was possible.

          First, create a React app like you normally would.{" "}
          <CodeBlock code={createReactApp} language="bash" />
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Next, add your code to a repository on Github. If you don't know about{" "}
          <code>git</code> or version control, start{" "}
          <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git">

          . <GithubOutlined />
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          GitHub not only provides version control, but "Actions". They let you
          run/build code on their servers... FOR FREE! And yes, you could even
          host the site at github <a href="https://pages.github.com/">pages</a>{" "}
          without having to pay for shared hosting, or lease domain name.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          My Github actions consist of a simple single{" "}

            deploy workflow

            <li>
              Watches for code commits on the <code>main</code> branch
            </li>
            <li>
              When triggered, the actions build the React application, resulting
              in some HTML and JavaScript being generated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lastly, the actions transfer those files from the github server to
              my shared hosting server over FTP.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </Paragraph>
        <Title level={3}>cPanel / Shared Hosting Configuration</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          With the files on the shared server, we're ready to umm, "serve" the
          application. In the <a href="https://cpanel.net">cPanel</a> dashboard,
          click on the <code>Setup Node.js App</code> link.

            </Col>
          </Row>
          You'll then be presented with a simple form where you can specify
          where on the file system the application will live (application root).
          How you'd like people to find your react app (URL), and the name of
          the startup file.

            </Col>
          </Row>
          Notice we're setting up a "Node.js" app, not a "React" app. In simple
          terms, <code>Node</code> is what's actually serving the{" "}
          <code>React</code> app.

          I may be coming around to the idea of using React for simple/personal
