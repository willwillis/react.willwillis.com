# So what's this repo all about?

I've been jumping into the middle of React for over a decade, playing with Next.js, etc... With this project I wanted to start from scratch, and if features/functionality grows, to do it incrementally, and understand what it is I'm doing along the way.

# Features to implement, Some day
- TradingView Charts
- Web3 / Blockchain integration
- API calls / remote data
- Include more "Progressive" (offline) features
